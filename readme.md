# A project designed to understand how a database works
This is only an academic project designed to immitate the inner-workings of a dataabase using the language c with zero dependencies. This is also an excercise on implementing a tokenizer, parser, code generator and virtual machine. Most of which are principles of OS.

To build this project, simply clone this project and then compile it as follows:
````
make all

To run the database
